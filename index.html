          <p>We grow over 130,000 rainforest trees and plants per year of over 115 varieties. Our professional seed collectors have a strong focus 
            on species and genetic diversity, with priority for those that are threatened with extinction. We have everything from creekside shrubs 
            to emergent trees that grow 60m tall and extend high above the rainforest canopy, allowing our plantings to establish into complex, diverse rainforests. </p>

      <h3>Why are we planting a billion trees?</h3>
      <h5>Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals.
    
        Planting a billion trees can help save the Earth from climate change and biodiversity loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity. A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together.</h5>

        <h4>Beyonce Knowles</h4>
        <p>Chairperson/Singer/Composer</p>
        <p>Beyoncé, in full Beyoncé Giselle Knowles, (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.), 
          American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the
          R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career.</p>
          <P>At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s
             Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent 
             show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released.
             In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous 
             debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Their follow-up album, The Writing’s on 
             the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United 
             States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart.</P>

        <h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
        <p>Chairperson/Singer/Producer</p>
        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist.
          Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a 
          four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a 
          global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, 
          he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most
         awarded individual music artist in history.</p>
       <p>From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, 
         behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out 
         of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual 
         abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. 
         In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered 
         by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter.</p>

        <h4>Mariah Carey</h4>
        <p>Secretary/Singer/Producer</p>
        <p>Mariah Carey, (born March 27, 1969/70, Huntington, New York, U.S.), American pop singer, noted for her remarkable vocal range. 
          She was one of the most successful female performers of the 1990s and remained popular into the early 21st century.</p>
        <p>Depending on the source, Carey was born in 1969 or 1970. Her mother was a vocal coach and former opera singer, and Carey began 
          performing as a child. After graduating (1987) from high school in Greenlawn, New York, she moved to New York City to pursue a 
          singing career. Carey made a demo tape that led Tommy Mottola, an executive at Columbia Records, to sign her in 1988; the couple 
          married in 1993. Her debut album, Mariah Carey (1990), showcased her incredible vocal range and blended several musical genres, 
          including gospel, pop, and rhythm and blues (R&B). It was a huge success, and in 1991 Carey won Grammy Awards for best new artist 
          and best female pop vocalist. That same year the title track from her follow-up album, Emotions, became her fifth consecutive 
          chart-topping single. Subsequent hit albums included Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), both of which sold some 10 million 
          copies in the United States, as well as the holiday-themed Merry Christmas (1994). All the recordings were accompanied by music 
          videos that helped make Carey a fixture on the cable network MTV.</p>

        <h4>Justin Bieber</h4>
        <p>Secretary/Singer/Composer</p>
        <p>Justin Drew Bieber (/biːbər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer. Bieber is recognized for his genre-melding 
            musicianship and has played an influential role in modern-day popular music.[3] He was discovered by American record executive Scooter 
            Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon 
            establishing himself as a teen idol. Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), 
            which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[4] The album spawned the 
            internationally successful single "Baby", which became one of the highest certified singles of all time in the US.[5] His second studio 
            album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US.[6] Bieber 
            experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five 
            US number-one albums at age 18.[7] Between 2013 and 2014, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a 
            drastic impact on his public image.[</p>
          <p>Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited
             with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for "Baby", "Sorry" and "Despacito". He has received numerous accolades, including 
             two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American 
             Music Awards, 21 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), 
             and 33 Guinness World Records. Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on 
             Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.</p>
